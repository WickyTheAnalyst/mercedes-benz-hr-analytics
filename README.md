# Mercedes Benz HR Analytics

## Analyzing Employee Retention and Constructing a Machine Learning Model

*A case study by Waqas Ahmad*

## Overview

Mercedes-Benz's HR department is on a mission to boost employee satisfaction by uncovering the core factors that could trigger an employee's decision to leave the company.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to analyze the data collected by the HR department and develop a robust predictive model that can accurately forecast an employee's likelihood of leaving the company.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to identify factors that play a role in employees choosing to leave the company and suggest a way forward.

## Project Stages

### Stage 1: Import Data & Packages
- Import necessary data and Python packages for analysis.

### Stage 2: Data Exploration - EDA & Data Cleaning
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning to understand the dataset and prepare it for modeling.

### Stage 3: Building Models
- Explore two different approaches for building predictive models:
  - Approach A: Regression Modeling
  - Approach B: Tree-Based Modeling (Decision Tree & Random Forest)

### Stage 4: Model Evaluation & Sharing Insights
- Evaluate the models and share insights gained from them.

## Conclusion

The models and feature importance extracted from them confirm a critical issue within the companyâ€”employee overwork. This insight highlights several areas where action can be taken to improve employee retention and well-being.

## Recommendations

To retain employees and create a healthier work environment, consider the following recommendations for stakeholders:

- Cap Project Assignments: Implement a limit on the number of projects employees can work on simultaneously to prevent excessive workload.
- Tenure-Based Recognition: Recognize and promote employees who have been with the company for at least four years, and investigate the reasons behind the dissatisfaction of four-year tenured employees.
- Fair Workload and Overtime: Ensure fair compensation or incentives for employees working longer hours, or reconsider workload expectations.
- Communication and Policy Clarity: Inform employees about overtime pay policies, and clarify expectations regarding workload and time-off.
- Cultural Evaluation: Conduct company-wide and team-specific discussions to understand and address the work culture, seeking improvements in various contexts.
- Performance Reward Scaling: Review the evaluation score system to ensure that high scores are not reserved solely for employees working 200+ hours per month. Consider a proportionate scale for rewarding effort and contributions.

## Next Steps

While addressing the identified issues, consider the following next steps:

- Data Leakage Evaluation: Assess how predictions change when the 'last_evaluation' feature is removed from the data. Determine whether it's essential for predicting employee retention or whether other factors, such as performance or satisfaction scores, can be more informative.
- K-Means Analysis: For future projects, explore the use of a K-Means clustering model on this data to analyze employee clusters. This analysis may yield valuable insights into employee groups and their characteristics.

These actions and next steps aim to improve employee retention, foster a healthier work environment, and ensure data-driven decision-making in addressing workforce challenges.
